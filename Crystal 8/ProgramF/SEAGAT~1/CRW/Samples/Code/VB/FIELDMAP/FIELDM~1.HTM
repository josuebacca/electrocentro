<UL>
<LI><B><I>Summary:</I></B> Field mapping allows the user to change the name of
           a database field that a report field points to if
           that field no longer exists or has been renamed in
           the data source. <br><br>

           In this sample, the Report_FieldMapping event in the
           code for CrystalReport1 is used to programmatically
           change the mapping of the report fields to newly renamed database fields.  </LI></UL>
