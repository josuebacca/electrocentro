<LI><B><I>Summary:</I></B> There are two new methods that provide a convenient
           way to add ADO data sources to a report: <br><br>
           1.) AddADOCommand takes as parameters an active ADO connection
           and an ADO command object.  In this example, a new connection
           is created to a database, and the resulting recordset is assigned
           at runtime to the report <br><br>
           2.) AddOLEDBSource takes as parameters the name of an active
           ADO connection and the name of a table that can be accessed
           through that connection.  In this example, the connection set
           up through the VB Data Environment is used as a data source.</LI></UL>
