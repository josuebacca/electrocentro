<I><LI>Summary:</I> </B>Report Variables allow you to save values inside the report object while the report is being formatted. The format event for a given section is often triggered more than once during the report formatting process, making totalling using VB code a very difficult process. <BR><BR>

This sample shows how to use Report Variables to calculate totals based on only part of the data. Since Report Variables accept any valid value from the VB environment, you can use values that only exist at Runtime to change the formatting of your report.<B> </LI></UL>
