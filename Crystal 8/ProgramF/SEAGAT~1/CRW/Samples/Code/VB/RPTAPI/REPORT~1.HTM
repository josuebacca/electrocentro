<LI><B><I>Summary:</I></B> 
           The Creation API functions allow runtime creation of
           report objects; including text, database field, unbound
           field, blob field, chart, special, box, cross-tab, line,
           picture, summary and subreport objects.<br><br>

           These report objects can either be added at runtime to
           an existing report created in the VB designer, or (as
           shown in this sample) a blank report can be created and
           objects added to that blank report.  All properties that
           are normally available for each object at runtime are
           also available for these objects.<br><br>

           This sample shows how to create text, database field,
           unbound field, summary, picture box and line objects.  For
           a larger demonstration of advanced uses of the Creation API,
           please see the Pro Athlete Salaries sample located in the
           Crystal Reports 8.0 VB samples directory.
