<LI><B><I>Summary:</I></B> In this sample, there are five unbound fields created
           in the report.  Notice that there is no data source
           added to the report at design time at all -- the data
           source is created and added to the report at runtime.
           Unbound fields can also be used as formulas, although
           this sample does not demonstrate this use.

           Unbound fields allow for great flexibility, since you can
           change easily change the data source for an unbound field at
           runtime.
