<LI><B><I>Summary:</I></B> The Search and Select Wizards allow advanced filtering
           and highlighting of data displayed in the ActiveX viewer.
           In this sample, two different methods of using the
           Search and Select Wizards are demonstrated. <br><br>

           1.) Two command buttons on the main form display a search
               or select wizard with predefined fields and ranges
               already set for the user.  The only displayed fields
               and ranges are those that have been added at runtime <br><br>

           2.) The Search and Select Expert buttons on the top right
               part of the viewer are over-ridden, allowing the
               programmer to specify default criteria to search for.
               Alternatively, the default search and select experts
               can also be displayed</LI></UL>
