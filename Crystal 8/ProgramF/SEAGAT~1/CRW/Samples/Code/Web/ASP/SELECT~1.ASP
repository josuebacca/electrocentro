' This application is designed to demonstrate how to define a

'Create the Crystal Reports Objects
'===================================================================================
'
'You will notice that the Crystal Reports objects are scoped as session variables.
'This is because the page on demand processing is performed by a prewritten
'ASP page called "rptserver.asp".  In order to allow rptserver.asp easy access 
'to the Crystal Report objects, we scope them as session variables.  That way
'any ASP page running in this session, including rptserver.asp, can use them.

reportname = "SelectionFormula.rpt"

'This line creates a string variable called reportname that we will use to pass
'the Crystal Report filename (.rpt file) to the OpenReport method.
'To re-use this code for your application you would change the name of the report
'so as to reference your report file.

' CREATE THE APPLICATION OBJECT

'This "if/end if" structure is used to create the Crystal Reports Application
'object only once per session.  Creating the application object - session("oApp")
'loads the Crystal Report Design Component automation server (craxdrt32.dll) into memory.
'
'We create it as a session variable in order to use it for the duration of the
'ASP session.  This is to elimainate the overhead of loading and unloading the
'craxdrt32.dll in and out of memory.  Once the application object is created in
'memory for this session, you can run many reports without having to recreate it.

'1.  The print engine is executed on the Web Server, so any error messages
'    will be displayed there.  If an error is reported on the web server, the
'    print engine will stop processing and you application will "hang".
'
'2.  This ASP page and rptserver.asp have some error handling logic desinged
'    to trap any non-fatal errors (such as failed database connectivity) and
'    display them to the client browser.
'
'**IMPORTANT**  Even though we disable the extended error messaging of the engine
'fatal errors can cause an error dialog to be displayed on the Web Server machine.
'For this reason we reccomend that you set the "Allow Service to Interact with Desktop"
'option on the "World Wide Web Publishing" service (IIS service).  That way if your ASP
'application freezes you will be able to view the error dialog (if one is displayed).

' INSTANTIATE THE CRYSTAL REPORTS SMART VIEWER
'
'When using the Crystal Reports automation server in an ASP environment, we use
'the same page on demand "Smart Viewers" used with the Crystal Web Report Server.
'The are four Crystal Reports Smart Viewers:
'
'1.  ActiveX Smart Viewer
'2.  Java Smart Viewer
'3.  HTML Frame Smart Viewer
'4.  HTML Page Smart Viewer
'
'The Smart Viewer that you use will based on the browser's display capablities.
'For Example, you would not want to instantiate the Java viewer if the browser
'Line 200
'did not support Java applets.  For purposes on this demo, we have chosen to
'define a viewer.  You can through code determine the support capabilities of
'the requesting browser.  However that functionality is inherent in the Crystal
'Reports automation server and is beyond the scope of this demonstration app.
'
'We have chosen to leverage the server side include functionality of ASP
'for simplicity sake.  So you can use the SmartViewer*.asp files to instantiate
'the smart viewer that you wish to send to the browser.  Simply replace the line
'below with the Smart Viewer asp file you wish to use.
'
'The choices are SmartViewerActiveX.asp, SmartViewerJave.asp,
'SmartViewerHTMLFrame.asp, and SmartViewerHTMLPAge.asp.
'Note that to use this include you must have the appropriate .asp file in the 
'same virtual directory as the main ASP page.
'
'*NOTE* For SmartViewerHTMLFrame and SmartViewerHTMLPage, you must also have
'the files framepage.asp and toolbar.asp in your virtual directory.
